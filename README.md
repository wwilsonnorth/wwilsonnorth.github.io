# Portfolio
This is my first multi page website I have created by myself in order to introduce myself, my skillset and display my work as a developer. I used HTML and CSS throughout making the website as clean and minimalistic as I could. The website is 95% complete with only some media queries to add in order to make it fully responsive and a refactor of my code to finish things up.
